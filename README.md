**Introduction**:
In the world of measurement tools, traditional sampling methods have long been a staple of data collection. However, with the emergence of Analog-to-Information Converters (AICs), significant advancements have been made in data collection techniques. AICs offer advantages such as reduced data acquisition time, improved measurement accuracy, and enhanced signal clarity. However, issues such as increased energy consumption and potential limitations in signal processing capabilities must also be considered.

One area of innovation in digital signal processing is the concept of differentiable processing. This approach allows for the optimization of signal processing algorithms through the use of gradient-based optimization techniques. By incorporating differentiability in signal processing algorithms, researchers can create more efficient and precise processing methods for various applications.

Smart algorithms have also made significant strides in detection and fault diagnosis. Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques can be employed to identify and detect faults in systems with high accuracy and efficiency. These intelligent algorithms can analyze large volumes of data to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate a fault, enabling preventive maintenance and improving system reliability.

Image-based methods for torque estimation have been employed, providing a more accurate and reliable method for measuring torque in industrial applications. By utilizing images in conjunction with advanced algorithms, researchers can estimate the torque with greater accuracy and clarity than traditional methods.

Harmonic FMCW radar systems provide a unique solution for passive tag detection and accurate range estimation. By using harmonic frequencies in frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar systems, researchers can identify passive tags at greater distances with higher precision compared to traditional radar systems. This technology has applications in asset tracking, security, and monitoring.

Doppler-tolerant radar waveforms have been developed for surveillance applications, enabling more precise detection and tracking of moving targets in noisy environments. Researchers can enhance the performance of surveillance systems under challenging conditions through careful design of radar waveforms that are tolerant to Doppler effects and noise.

Finally, measuring and analyzing the signal coverage of 4G, 5G, and 6G in heavy industry environments is crucial for ensuring reliable communication networks in these vital and essential areas. By analyzing signal strength, coverage areas, and potential sources of interference, researchers can optimize network performance and ensure seamless connectivity for industrial applications.
