Integration of advanced industrial technologies and 4G/5G/6G generation network and newest generation of network analyzer devices with analog to information converters for fault detection and control systems and related issues(4G-5G-Mobile-Signal-Coverage-in-a-Factory)

The research was carried out at the Arak Steel Company and Tabarestan Plastic Company. factories located at Qom and Arak provinces in Iran, renowned companies involved in the manufacturing and distribution of machine tools. With a fully equipped facility that includes a foundry located on site, companies can manage all aspects of machine production from start to finish. This includes everything from designing and producing models and castings to their treatment, machining, and final assembly. The factory's unique environment, with challenges such as multipath propagation, noise, and a high level of foot traffic, provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of wireless networks in a real-world industrial setting.
